      question: "Is BTCRecoveryPro a legit and licensed recovery firm?",
      answer: "Yes. BTCRecoveryPro is a duly registered consulting agency in the United Arab Emirates. The company operates under an IT & network consultancy license issued at Ajman Free Zone, and the recovery processes are all under NDAs and client confidentiality guidelines."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to share my private keys or wallet passwords?",
      answer: "Never! Your privacy and security come first. We never ask for private keys or full access to your wallet. All our recovery operations happen offline in highly secure environments with non-invasive forensic techniques."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does the recovery service cost?",
      answer: "Our model is results-first. For most recovery cases, there are no upfront feesâ€”you only pay 50% of the recovered amount after successful recovery. Scam tracing services, due to their complexity, require a non-refundable processing fee of $200."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you really recover funds sent to the wrong blockchain or address?",
      answer: "In most cases, yes. From USDT sent from ERC20 to BEP20 or assets getting stuck in improper cross-chain bridges, our specialists handle these situations technically and try to reclaim those lost tokens."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the recovery process take?",
      answer: "Every case is different. A wallet recovery might take anywhere from 24 to 48 hours; tracking cases or cross-chain situations might take a few more days. We keep you updated with timelines based on your specific situation."
